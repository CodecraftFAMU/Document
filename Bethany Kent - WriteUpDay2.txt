Day 2 - Write Up
Today was maybe one of the most eye-openning experiences I've ever had. When Avery said we would be working on a coding website, I could help but remmeber how disgusted I had been by the previous clubs I had been in, where all you did was tell Elsa to go in a rectangle to save Olaf. I was pleasantly suprised to find out that during the Nova Labs Exercise, I was one of the top three that finished all three levels and did decently overall. I plan on playing some more in my free time and seeing if I can do better and actually read the instructions. I wasn't a fan of the Hex Decryption, it was confusing and didn't seem like it taught us very much besides patience while scrolling through lines and lines of code. I couldn't imagine having that as a job, unless you really loved it. The SQL Injection was strange and seemed like busy work more than an example of how professionals use them to understand computers. Overall, the Nova Labs were my favorite activity and I'm considering looking into a camp that Avery reccomended that further teaches people all about THAT kind of cyber security. The Hex Decryption came second since I had never been exposed to something like that but was still confusing, and the Injection exercise came last since it wasn't very helpful or go along with what we were studying.
