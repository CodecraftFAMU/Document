Day 1: Write Up
Walking in today, I wasn’t sure what to expect. I certainly wasn’t expecting to make friends with younger boys or enjoy the cafeteria. First, the Javascript Training-Secure was easy to understand once we had all worked through it and talked about it. Some of the code looked interesting but would take a while for me to understand it as much as the counsellors do. It was well worth the work, for seeing how a simple password could be found, hidden in a maze of words. Next, “This won’t take long…” took more effort to achieve the goal of finding the password. It was a bit confusing but not very interesting. Next time, I’ll know putting in more work makes it easier to decode. Then, Escape Now!!, was the hardest and most time consuming of all of the problems that we did. It was actually very interesting and I would want to play it again. It required difficult thinking, but beating it was a great prize. Finally, Cookies.sqlite gave everyone the most problems with tricky wording but during the long process time, everyone got to know each other better. Javascript training was probably the easiest of all the challenges, but was confusing at first. This won't take long... didn't take very long but was actually interesting and raised class discussion. Next, Escape Now was the funniest and is a challenge I would like to do again if I get the chance. Finally, Cookies.sqlite was the most time consuming and confusing since it was easy to mess it up.
