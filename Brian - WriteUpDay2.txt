Today’s instructions were, like yesterday’s, easy to follow for many advanced developers, but would be hard to follow and would require instruction from newer developers or to users with no development experience what-so-ever. I imagine that the SQL Injection would be harder for my classmates who didn’t have previous SQL experience. The Hex exercise would also be harder for my classmates, who have absolutely no idea what hexadecimal codes are for letters. The Nova Labs exercise was doable without instruction.
